Anant Bhatia Log:

Accomplishments:

- Researched difference between multiclass logistic regression, naive bayes algorithm, and multi-ouput regressors
- Determined to test all algorithms on the dataset, although NaiveBayes seems like the easiest way to
predict probability dsitrubtion
- Tackling the independence assumptions between longitude and latitude is trivialized with Naive Bayes,
although may not lead to most accurate results
- Logistic regression would need to be over 400 classes given an input space of a smaller size.
Seems to run into space-sparisty problems, and generally doesn't seem like a good idea.
- May have to manually perfom maximum likliehood estimation for naive bayes algorithm due to multiple output
- It seems as though a longitude-latitude independence assumption would trivialize the problem,
but am still wary of the results.

Goals for tomorrow:

- Implement logisitc regression and naive bayes using independence assumption
- Research more methods for mulitple output to bypass independence assumption

What I learnt:

- Refresher on maximum likliehood estimation and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
- Learnt about Desision Trees and Ensemble methods, though useless for this project

Anant Bhatia Log:

Accomplishments:

- Tried fitting Categorical Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and simple MLP to the given data
- Wrote script to format the data such that coordinates are rounded to values
- Debugged the accuracy problem. For all of the given data, I was getting a maximum of 15% training accuracy, which is extremely
low. After some debugging, I realized it was a error in the logic - I was trying to map a lower imensional space to one of higher dimension and expect to gain infromation. This is, of course, a faulty premise and ruins the entire prediction process to some extent. Addtionally, since time and type of crime are not good indicators of location on average, and due to the fact that the mapping is a fucntion, the output space was limited to 6 of the 25 given options. The idea is essentially that the model learns to predict crimes of a larger frequency, irrelevant of the time of year.
- It seems as though predict class probabilities should still work to some extent. Only time will tell.
- Finally, I realized that I can actually try to create a function to map longitudes such that it is a relatively een distribution to avoid independences issues.

Goals for tomorrow:

-Try Linear regressing long and lat, and then subtracting this y^hat from both lon and lat to normalize.
- Try creating intial json of predictions to ship to Michael

Anant Bhatia Log:

Accomplishments:

- Got predictions using Categorical Naive Bayes algorithm
- Shipped JSON to Michael
- Developed script to take input CSV and ship output of properl formatted predictions
- Performed Chi Squared test of Independence to check association between longitude and latitude
- Performed linear regression to check geographical patterns in longitude and latitude
- Conclusion: Longitude and Latitude are obviously not independent in terms of predicting crim,
so the current method of multiplication assumping independence is faulty

Goals for tomorrow:

- Documentation of code
- Help Micahel with his work

Anant Bhatia Log:

Accomplishments:

- Created corrected JSONS
- Helped Michael with figuring out coordinates on the heatmap
- Today was kind of a chill day

Goals for tomorrow:

-Help Michael with anything he needs
- Document all the code written so far
- Finish Michaels Document, at least the ML part
