Anant Bhatia Log:

Accomplishments:

- Researched difference between multiclass logistic regression, naive bayes algorithm, and multi-ouput regressors
- Determined to test all algorithms on the dataset, although NaiveBayes seems like the easiest way to
predict probability dsitrubtion
- Tackling the independence assumptions between longitude and latitude is trivialized with Naive Bayes,
although may not lead to most accurate results
- Logistic regression would need to be over 400 classes given an input space of a smaller size.
Seems to run into space-sparisty problems, and generally doesn't seem like a good idea.
- May have to manually perfom maximum likliehood estimation for naive bayes algorithm due to multiple output
- It seems as though a longitude-latitude independence assumption would trivialize the problem,
but am still wary of the results.

Goals for tomorrow:

- Implement logisitc regression and naive bayes using independence assumption
- Research more methods for mulitple output to bypass independence assumption

What I learnt:

- Refresher on maximum likliehood estimation and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
- Learnt about Desision Trees and Ensemble methods, though useless for this project
