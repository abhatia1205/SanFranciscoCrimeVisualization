Accomplishments:

- Researched difference between multiclass logistic regression, naive bayes algorithm, and multi-output regressors
- Determined to test all algorithms on the dataset, although NaiveBayes seems like the easiest way to
predict probability distribution
- Tackling the independence assumptions between longitude and latitude is trivialized with Naive Bayes,
although may not lead to most accurate results
- Logistic regression would need to be over 400 classes given an input space of a smaller size.
Seems to run into space-sparsity problems, and generally doesn't seem like a good idea.
- May have to manually perform maximum likelihood estimation for naive bayes algorithm due to multiple output
- It seems as though a longitude-latitude independence assumption would trivialize the problem,
but am still wary of the results.

Goals for tomorrow:

- Implement logistic regression and naive bayes using independence assumption
- Research more methods for multiple output to bypass independence assumption

What I learnt:

- Refresher on maximum likelihood estimation and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
- Learnt about Decision Trees and Ensemble methods, though useless for this project
