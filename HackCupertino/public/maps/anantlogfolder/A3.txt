Accomplishments:

- Got predictions using Categorical Naive Bayes algorithm
- Shipped JSON to Michael
- Developed script to take input CSV and ship output of properly formatted predictions
- Performed Chi Squared test of Independence to check association between longitude and latitude
- Performed linear regression to check geographical patterns in longitude and latitude
- Conclusion: Longitude and Latitude are obviously not independent in terms of predicting crim,
so the current method of multiplication assuming independence is faulty

Goals for tomorrow:

- Documentation of code
- Help Michael with his work
