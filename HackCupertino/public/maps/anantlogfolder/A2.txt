Accomplishments:

- Tried fitting Categorical Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and simple MLP to the given data
- Wrote script to format the data such that coordinates are rounded to values
- Debugged the accuracy problem. For all of the given data, I was getting a maximum of 15% training accuracy, which is extremely
  low. After some debugging, I realized it was a error in the logic - I was trying to map a lower dimensional space to one of higher
  dimension and expect to gain information. This is, of course, a faulty premise and ruins the entire prediction process to some
  extent. Additionally, since time and type of crime are not good indicators of location on average, and due to the fact that the
  mapping is a function, the output space was limited to 6 of the 25 given options. The idea is essentially that the model learns to
  predict crimes of a larger frequency, irrelevant of the time of year.
- It seems as though predict class probabilities should still work to some extent. Only time will tell.
- Finally, I realized that I can actually try to create a function to map longitudes such that it is a relatively een distribution to
  avoid independences issues.

Goals for tomorrow:

- Try Linear regressing long and lat, and then subtracting this y^hat from both lon and lat to normalize.
- Try creating intial json of predictions to ship to Michael
