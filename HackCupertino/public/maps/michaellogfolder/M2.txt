Day 2 was a little slower than Day 1. My lack of sleep and the fact that I'm waking up a few hours earlier than usual is kicking in.

Today's work:
    Set up button links from the main index page
        had more struggles than I probably should have in doing this
            didn't properly capitalize one of my page links and spent roughly 20 minutes trying to figure that out
            forgot how to turn buttons into links --> <a><button></button></a> I actually forgot how to do this and had to look it up
            might sound like a bit of a chump/3rd rate programmer with 4th rate coding confidence, but I swear it's not usually like this
    Set up testing data for heatmap generation; generated actual heatmap
        spent a great deal of time reading the testing code that Google Maps JS API provides on heatmaps
            had to use function(exports) which I don't quite understand
            ended up using the Google Maps sample code to debug my own code and find the problems
            put the map generation part of the JS in <head></head> and the button parts in <body></body>
                it wouldn't work otherwise, not sure why
                it works now and that's what matters
        spent a long long time, and didn't get to try implementing this data with Firebase Realtime DB; will do tomorrow
    Wrote a short article on the ethics of predicting crime in Google Drive
        already had much of the article thought out ahead of time, put it into words today
        pretty happy with how it turned out, I hope the judges read it (they probably won't, I know), because it is rather meaningful in context of this project
        there's no way to access it from within the project yet, that changes tomorrow
Tomorrow:
    Set up testing data in Firebase Realtime DB to convert to heatmap
        stupid little thing (that will inevitably be a huge pain): Firebase Realtime DB has some strange restrictions on data, most notably that it can't include the following: [ ] . $ #
            will need to replace decimal points through Java file, then reconvert them in JS (will be a huge pain)
        if Anant gets jsons to me tomorrow, I can also test those
            priority is still just to get the system working
            will need to manage layering and getting the correct json branch based on HTML <select> elements that user inputs
    Write more content for the site
        start problem statement, project overview
        work on "About Us" page
            maybe get headshots?
                Anant has one on FB, but I don't and I'm feeling a little self conscious about myself after this long in quarantine but it'll be ok
    Work on connecting articles/overall project overview to the index page (utilize unbound buttons)
