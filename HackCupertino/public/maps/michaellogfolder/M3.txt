Woke up a bit later than yesterday, around 30 minutes. Needed the sleep.

Today's work:
    Finishing setup for Firebase Realtime DB
        forgot to set up a storage bucket for the Database, was an honest mistake. I set it up today.
        actually set up Firebase code today; wasn't using it before, so I didn't bother with it
            unfortunately, setting up Firebase resulted in a flurry of other issues
                weird error telling me the initMap function doesn't exist
                    fixed this by changing maps API src script line to not defer, I'm honestly not sure why that changes anything
                my map literally didn't work anymore
                    downloaded all the CDNs through Webstorm instead of using Google's hosting URLs, which solved the problem of: it literally wasn't working before
                        sidenote: not sure where the files actually downloaded to, I just hit download haha
                    for more clarity:
                        the reason my google maps API key is public is because I have it restricted so that only the web version of the project can use it
                        every time I load my proj in my local environment, it briefly loads the map, then covers it with an error message
                            error message is intended, it tells me that this environment doesn't have access to the API usage, so my restrictions are working
                        when I say it "didn't work anymore," the map itself (including error msg) weren't loading due to a JS issue
                slowly lost my sanity over the course of the two hours that it took to add Firebase code while making sure old functions work
        the DB has some built in security measures for privacy --> the site doesn't allow for unlimited access to reading the DB's information
            fixed the issue, I think?
    Temporary (probably permanent) verdict for Firebase Realtime DB: WE'RE NOT USING IT.
        spent something like three hours working with it, and for the most part, I got most of what I wanted to work
            was able to print information from the Realtime DB to console (just changed DB rules to make it publicly accessible)
        ultimately, the one thing that stood in the way was integration with google maps API
            the heatmap refused to generate with the points I was getting from the Firebase DB, don't really know why
                found a tutorial for firebase and heatmap integrated code on google website
                    the tutorial itself isn't quite what we're trying to do; it adds map-clicks to the firebase db, which I don't really want to do
                ultimately don't feel confident in my ability to sort this out within the next two days (and work on remainder of additional material to submit)
                    still need to write a bit more for overall project summary
                    still have other things to implement and add to the site
                alternative solution: just going to manually input all points and make a separate page for each map
                    still works, isn't a huge issue in terms of data, explanation below
                        12 months in a year
                        39 different classifications for crime listed below (these are the ones in the dataset)
                            OTHER OFFENSES

                        50 highest likelihood points plotted
                        12*39=468 separate pages
                        12*39*50 = 23400 separate points
                        the big issue at hand is the 468 separate pages I have to generate, which I very much don't want to have to do
                        current solution: get rid of some of the classifications
                            there's a good reason to do this, listed below are choices and explanations (they're marked in the above list with asterisks)
                                NON-CRIMINAL
                                    we are focused on reporting crime; these points are not necessarily crime, but moments when police intervened (not valid)
                                WARRANTS
                                    warrants are not necessarily the site of crimes
                                        could be the addresses of criminals; such addresses may not have a real relationship with locations of crime
                                    ultimately not guaranteed to be relevant enough
                                DRUNKENNESS
                                    not important for user to know where people choose to get drunk
                                    not valuable information for authorities --> points most likely circulate around bars/clubs
                                FORGERYANDCOUNTERFEITING
                                    not important for user to know where people forge money
                                    not valuable information for authorities --> not enough cases, also offers very little information regarding socioeconomic status of area
                                SECONDARY CODES
                                    looked it up, not clear as to what this is, shouldn't be that important
                                TRESPASS
                                    not important for user to know where property is trespassed upon --> application is largely targeted towards providing tourists with information --> tourists would not own property in the area
                                FRAUD
                                    not important for user to know where an individual is arrested for fraud/address of fraudulent individual
                                RUNAWAY
                                    not important for user to know where runaways are found/where minors run away from
                                DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE
                                    not important for user to know where drunk drivers are caught --> act of crime is mobile, not restricted to location
                                        location where individual is apprehended is not as relevant as location where individual began driving, which we cannot guarantee is the location provided
                                DISORDERLY CONDUCT
                                    disorderly conduct encompasses many "crimes" that are in reality mere annoyances; I do not consider them of enough importance
                                        i.e. public drunkenness, loitering, violating noise ordinances
                                    too broad to represent the variety of different scenarios under the same map
                                FAMILY OFFENSES
                                    "a crime committed against a relative or other person whom the perpetrator has an intimate relationship with"
                                        can't find a reasonable way to link this to location, too broad to represent the variety of different scenarios under the same map
                                LIQUOR LAWS
                                    not important for user to know where minors buy alcohol, where alcohol is sold to a minor/without a license
                                    DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE is also removed
                                SUICIDE
                                    self explanatory, creating a map displaying where suicides occur without context is absurd and unnecessary
                                BRIBERY
                                    not important for user to know where bribery occurs
                                EMBEZZLEMENT
                                    not important for user to know where embezzlement of funds occurs
                                LOITERING
                                    legal definition of "loitering" is very loose and open to interpretation
                                    the homeless in SF are largely left alone, what constitutes loitering is too unclear without context
                                SEX OFFENSES NON FORCIBLE
                                    "sexual conduct with individuals the law assumes... not capable of giving consent" i.e. physically/mentally disabled, minors
                                    too broad to represent the variety of different scenarios under the same map (i.e. minors can verbally give consent without legally being able too, much too convoluted)
                                EXTORTION
                                    too broad to represent the variety of different scenarios under the same map
                                    could be political, personal, organized crime, etc
                                GAMBLING
                                    not important for user to know where gambling occurs in San Francisco (tourists are not likely to take place in this/be worried of it)
                                BAD CHECKS
                                    not important for user to know where individuals are arrested for bounced checks/insufficient funds
                                TREA
                                    stands for "trespassing/loitering near posted industrial property"
                                    not important for user to know the locations of industrial property (they're tourists, not contractors)
                                RECOVERED VEHICLE
                                    much more valuable to know where vehicles are taken, not found; is irrelevant
                                PORNOGRAPHYANDOBSCENE MAT
                                    not important for user to know where people are arrested for indecency
                            23 points listed above, 16 remaining
                        12*16=192 pages
                        12*6*50=9600 separate points
                            192 is still a lot, but much more manageable
    Wrote a bit more for the Project Overview
        didn't have time to link this or the ethics article in, just going to push it back again
    Received the json results file
Tomorrow:
    Tomorrow is going to be a bad day.
        need to cut all the removed sections out of the file
            won't have to do this manually, will write a java process to do it for me which will inevitably take longer than just doing it manually; such is the programmer way
        need to parse the json file and convert them into format that's easy to insert into JavaScript file
            will probably do this with a java process that'll take forever to debug as usual; such is also the programmer way
        need to then write a java process that'll take that and generate 215 HTML pages (I already have 1)
            did I mention that tomorrow was going to be a bad day?
    Write a bit more for Project Overview if I have the effort in me to do so

Postnote:
    I'm losing track of time; thought today was Thursday. Although, at the time of me writing this, it is almost Thursday. Sleep deprivation is a 4/10, would not recommend.

Note to self:
    Spending less time on reddit would allow for better tracking of time
